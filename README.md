# Sentiment_Analysis_RomanUrdu_DataSet
 This project implements a sentiment analysis pipeline for Roman Urdu text data. It involves loading and preprocessing text, including cleaning and transforming data using TfidfVectorizer to extract meaningful features. The project trains several machine learning models, such as LogisticRegression, LinearSVC, and others, to classify sentiment. It evaluates model performance using confusion matrices and classification reports and saves both the trained models and vectorizers for future use. The provided script (Sentiment Analysis.ipynb) demonstrates the complete workflow, including training, evaluation, and prediction on new text data, with all necessary files and dependencies listed for easy setup and execution.
